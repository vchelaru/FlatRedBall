            Unsubscribes from controller connection events and join/unjoin logic. This is automatically called
            when the control is removed so it does not need to be called manually unless the control is created

        <member name="M:FlatRedBall.Forms.Controls.Games.PlayerJoinView.SubscribeToGamepadEvents">
            <summary>
            Begins behavior to automatically detect gamepad connect and disconnect events. Also enables
            join and unjoin logic. This is automatically when the Visual is assigned, which is the default behavior when added
            through the FlatRedBall Editor.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            For convenience, SubscribeToGamepadEvents is called automatically when the visual is assigned. UnsubscribeFromGamepadEvents must 
            be called, but this happens automatically when the control is removed through the visual's RemoveFromManagers being called. This 
            method does not need to be called directly, but can happen as a result of its parent element being removed. Typically this is the
            Gum screen which is automatically removed when the FlatRedBall Screen is destroyed.
            
            Note that if the PlayerJoinView is constructed with a visual, but is never added to managers, then it will not unsubscribe
            from events. While minor, this does accumulate an event on InputManager.ControllerConnectionEvent.

            Whether pressing the B button (back/cancel) should result in individual items losing focus and

            Contains the default association between Forms Controls and Gum Runtime Types. 
            This dictionary enabled forms controls (like TextBox) to automatically create their own visuals.
            The key in the dictionary is the type of Forms control.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This dictionary simplifies working with FlatRedBall.Forms in code. It allows one piece of code 
            (which may be generated by Glue) to associate the Forms controls with a Gum runtime type. Once 
            this association is made, controls can be created without specifying a gum runtime. For example:
            var button = new Button();
            button.Visual.AddToManagers();
            button.Click += HandleButtonClick;
            
            Note that this association is used when instantiating a new Forms type in code, but it is not used when instantiating
            a new Gum runtime type - the Gum runtime must instantiate and associate its Forms object in its own code.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            FrameworkElement.DefaultFormsComponents[typeof(FlatRedBall.Forms.Controls.Button)] = 
                typeof(ProjectName.GumRuntimes.LargeMenuButtonRuntime);
            </example>
