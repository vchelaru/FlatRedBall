            Usually "Save" classes include a To[RuntimeType] method.  The CameraSave does not follow
            this pattern because it's most common that a CameraSave is loaded when a Camera is already
            created by the engine.  In this case, it's not very convenient to have to destroy the existing
            Camera and replace it by a new instance.  Instead, the SetCamera method will simply set the properties
            on an existing Camera

            This method initiates one emission of particles.  The number of particles emitted
            depends on the numberPerEmission variable.  This method does not consider emission timing, and the time
            is not recorded for emission timing.  
            
            The argument SpriteList stores all Sprites which were emitted
            during the call.  The Sprites are added regularly, rather than in a one way relationship.  This enables
            modification of emitted particles after the method ends.  null can be passed as an argument
            if specific action is not needed for emitted particles.  Particles are automatically created
            through the SpriteManager as Particle Sprites.

            This determines the ratio of the width to height of the camera.  By default, the aspect ratio is 4/3,

            a game is in split screen with a vertical split, then each camera will show the same height, but half the width.
            The aspect ratio should be 2/3.

            The purpose of this value is to prevent cameras from attempting to draw outside of the window's client bounds. A camera
            which has a viewport larger than the window client bounds will throw an exception. However, cameras (and layers) which render
            to a render target which is larger than the current window should be able to render to the full render target even if it is larger
            than the current window. Therefore, this value should be set to false if rendering to large render targets.

            Sets the visible borders when the camera is looking down the Z axis.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This sets visibility ranges for the camera.  That is, if the camera's maximumX is set to 100 at a zToSetAt of 
            0, the camera will never be able to see the point x = 101, z = 0.  The camera imposes these limitations 
            by calculating the actual minimum and maximum values according to the variables passed.  Also, 
            the camera keeps track of these visible limits and readjusts the mimimum and maximum values 
            when the camera moves in the z direction. Therefore, it is only necessary to set these 
            values once, and the camera will remeber that these are the visibility borders, regardless of 
            its position.  It is important to note that the visiblity borders can be violated if they are too 
            close together - if a camera moves so far back that its viewable area at the set Z is greater than 
            the set minimumX and maximumX range, the camera will show an area outside of this range.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            When the secondary (right) mouse button is pushed down, this value is set - either to null 
            if the mouse is not over any Windows or to the Window that the mouse is over.  
            When the secondary mouse button is released (clicked), this value is set to null.  
            This value is useful for clicking on Windows.  Specifically, when the cursor is clicked
            on a Button, the WindowPushed value is tested to make sure that it is the same as 
            the Window clicked on.  This allows for players to push on a Button but move 
            the mouse away and click elsewhere without clicking on the Button originally 
            pushed and without accidentally clicking on other Buttons.  This is also used
            with ToggleButtons to control when they are pressed and unpressed.

            <remarks>
            This value can be set to true if the Cursor should not move in response to input.
            The staticPosition value is only used by the engine when over the button on an UpDown.  When pushing down
            on an UpDown button, the staticPosition is set to true, and set to false when releasing the mouse button.

            When the mouse button is released, the windowGrabbed reference is set to null.  If a Window is grabbed, it will
            move as the mouse moves.  This is used commonly for dragging on menu bars and scroll bars.  The cursor does
            not recognize which types of Windows can be dragged, so windows must be grabbed through the Cursor.GrabWindow
            method.  The windowGrabbed's onDrag event is fired every frame.

            This means that an instruction may be scheuduled to execute in 10 seconds, then after its first execution
            it will repeat every second thereafter.

             In other words, the SpriteGrid does not create a new Sprite internally, but uses the
             arguemnt Sprite.  When creating SpriteGrids in code, it is common to create a new Sprite
             only to serve as a SpriteGrid blue print, then remove it from the SpriteManager's memory. 
             If the Sprite passed as the mBlueprintToUse is modified after the SpriteGrid is created,
             this will change the SpriteGrid bluerint

            To use the least amount of memory, TextureGrids only store non-baseTexture strips.

            inward.  If an entire horizontal strip is the baseTexture, then it should be removed.
            
            Usually, tests should begin from a specific location, as it is usually called after the

            the base texture.  Once it encounters a non-baseTexture, then it stops, and reduces the

            If an entire strip is cleared and it is either the top or bottom strip, then it will

            This method does not investigate the PositionedObjects any more than looking at their children.  It traverses

            <remarks>
            <para>A useful way to understand the affect of changeRelative is to consider that it is the opposite of whether 
            absolute values change.  That is, if the relative values do not change upon attachment, the absolute values
            will change.</para>
            <para>
            For an example, consider a situation where a child has an absolute x value of 5 and a relative value of 0 and
            a parent has an absolute x value of 0.  If the child is attached to the parent
            and relative is not changed (relative x remains at 0), then the child's x will be 
            parent.x + child.relX, or 0 + 0 = 0.  We see that the relative value didn't 
            change, so the absolute did.
            </para>
            <para>
            If, on the other hand, the relative was changed, the absolute position would be the same.
            Since the parent's absolute position was 0 and the absolute position of the 
            child should remain at 5, then the relX value would change to 5 (assuming 
            the parent isn't rotated).

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The SpriteManager is commonly used in FlatRedBall examples to create Sprites.  Perhaps the most
            common line of code is:
            
                Sprite sprite = SpriteManager.AddSprite("redball.bmp");
            
            Originally the SpriteManager was the only manager class.  For this reason it handled
            some of the functionality which may have normally belonged to classes unrelated to Sprites.
            For example, Cameras are added and managed through the SpriteManager although they are a general
            rendering class which might belong in the Renderer or FlatRedBallServices class.

            Sprites in this list have all of their behavioral properties

            Velocity, Acceleration, rotational velocity, and color rates.
            This manage requires overhead which can become a significant portion
            of frame time, so moving Sprites to be manually updated can improve performance.
            
            Most methods which create Sprites will place the created Sprite in this list.

            Computes Adler32 checksum for a stream of data. An Adler32
            checksum is not as reliable as a CRC32 checksum, but a lot faster to
            compute.
            
            The specification for Adler32 may be found in RFC 1950.
            ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3)
            
            
            From that document:
            
                 "ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum)
                  This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data
                  (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32
                  algorithm. This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement
                  of the Fletcher algorithm, used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073
                  standard.
            
                  Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is
                  the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums
                  are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.  The
                  Adler-32 checksum is stored as s2*65536 + s1 in most-
                  significant-byte first (network) order."
            
             "8.2. The Adler-32 algorithm
            
               The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet
               still provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
            
               The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552
               bytes, so the modulo operation time is negligible.  If the bytes
               are a, b, c, the second sum is 3a + 2b + c + 3, and so is position
               and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is just a
               checksum.  That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible
               large class of two-byte errors that leave the check unchanged.
               (The Fletcher checksum uses 255, which is not prime and which also
               makes the Fletcher check insensitive to single byte changes 0 -
               255.)
            
               The sum s1 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length
               of the sequence part of s2, so that the length does not have to be
               checked separately. (Any sequence of zeroes has a Fletcher
               checksum of zero.)"

             <summary>
             Inflater is used to decompress data that has been compressed according
             to the "deflate" standard described in rfc1951.
             
             By default Zlib (rfc1950) headers and footers are expected in the input.
             You can use constructor <code> public Inflater(bool noHeader)</code> passing true
             if there is no Zlib header information
            
             The usage is as following.  First you have to set some input with
             <code>SetInput()</code>, then Inflate() it.  If inflate doesn't
             inflate any bytes there may be three reasons:
             <ul>
             <li>IsNeedingInput() returns true because the input buffer is empty.
             You have to provide more input with <code>SetInput()</code>.
             NOTE: IsNeedingInput() also returns true when, the stream is finished.
             </li>
             <li>IsNeedingDictionary() returns true, you have to provide a preset
                dictionary with <code>SetDictionary()</code>.</li>
             <li>IsFinished returns true, the inflater has finished.</li>
             </ul>
             Once the first output byte is produced, a dictionary will not be
             needed at a later stage.

             This class allows us to retrieve a specified number of bits from
             the input buffer, as well as copy big byte blocks.
            
             It uses an int buffer to store up to 31 bits for direct
             manipulation.  This guarantees that we can get at least 16 bits,
             but we only need at most 15, so this is all safe.
            
             There are some optimizations in this class, for example, you must
             never peek more than 8 bits more than needed, and you must first
             peek bits before you may drop them.  This is not a general purpose
             class but optimized for the behaviour of the Inflater.
