After Installing my Flatredball,I found I can't boot Sprite Editor with an error.

The error reads:
"System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Cannot Load the file or assembly 'Microsoft.DirectX,Version = 1.0.2902.0 , Culture = neutral,PublicKeyToken = 31bf3856ad364e35' or its certain dependency
  at SpriteEditor.GameForm..ctor()
  at SpriteEditor.GameForm.Main(String[] args)"
  
I used the install package from your website to install the FRB.
My Platform is Windows 10.
I've install each of the components.
I suppose that maybe you forgot something in the code.
